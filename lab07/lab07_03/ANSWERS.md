## c)

Analyze the results report and try to answer the following questions:

• What metrics are contributing the most to the frontend perceived performance? What do
they mean?

R: Largest Contentful Paint: 3.1 s
First Contentful Paint: 2.8 s
They mean that the time it takes to load the largest contentful paint and the first contentful paint are the metrics contributing to reduce the frontend perceived performance.

• How would you make the site more accessible?

R: Improve the background and foreground colors to have a sufficient contrast ratio.

## d)

Use the Chrome browser and open the Developer Tools, namely the “lighthouse” tab. Perform the analysis for the same site and compare with the previous results. Use an incognito tab (why?).

R: The results are diferent, the incognito tab is used to avoid the cache, cookies, etc.

## e)

Using the embed Lighthouse tool in Chrome, make the analysis considering a desktop device.
Are the results the same as the previous ones or are they different? Why?

R: The results are better than the previous ones, because the desktop device has more resources than the mobile device.

## f)

The activities in this lab are also testing, but no functional test was made.
Why are the different aspects (performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO) worth
testing?

R: Because they are important to the user experience and the site performance. Considering that the user experience is the most important thing in a site, it is important to test these aspects.

## g)

What are the main problems, and which are their impacts? How easy is it to fix issues in a site
that has been live for a long time? Could this be avoided and how?

R: The main problems are the accessibility and the performance. The accessibility problems can be fixed, but the performance problems cannot be fixed because the site has been live for a long time. This could be avoided by testing the site before it goes live.
